About Myself - the author
Hi, I'm Cathy Park. I'm currently a student at the School of Information in the University of Michigan with a special focus on UI/UX Design and a minor in Applied Statistics. I love visiting different restaurants and exploring various types of food. I grew up many different places such as Seoul, Seattle, Ann Arbor, etc. I thought I would like to keep a record of the places that I went and share with the others! 
I will have a picture of myself in this page along with a brief description about myself and this page.
