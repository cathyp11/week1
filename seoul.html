About restaurants that I've visited in Seoul. This page would contain a grid format of images with the title of the restaurants under each image. The images are all in jpg format and those are badfarmers, byeol, coreanos, downtowner, firebell, kimildo, miltop, tastingroom, and tuktuk. These images are all named after the restaurant so that it's easier for me to use them when creating this page. All images will be in a square-format. More pictures will be added later.
