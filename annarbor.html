	About restaurants in Ann Arbor. I've visited several restaurants in Ann Arbor during university. Similar to the "Seoul" page, I would like to create a specialized page for Ann Arbor restaurants. Since this page is similar to "Seoul" page, I only included one of the images that I'll use for this page: "macaron.png".
